# Roguelike Pang (working title: Bubblewright)

A prototype of a roguelike game inspired by Pang (bubble-splitting arcade action), built in **Unity 2D (URP)**.

Platforms, in priority order: Mobile, then Desktop, then Console.

## Goal of this prototype

Nail the design, animations and movement before building the polished game in a separate project.

Plan:
1. Visual direction and design sheet (done: [design sheet](https://claude.ai/artifact/1gTaySmyLvPqnkRrDUxyZ5))
2. Repo and movement prototype (this)
3. Animation and game-feel pass
4. Thin roguelike loop (procedural stages, permadeath, upgrades between levels, meta-progression)

## What step 2 contains

One stage of World 1 (Rooftops) built entirely from code, using the numbers from the design sheet:

- **Wick** runs on the floor only (no jump): 9 u/s top speed, reached in 0.06 s, stops in 0.04 s. He plays with his back to the camera, faces it at stage start, turns with a 0.2 s squash, and turns back to celebrate after the last pop. His candle flame shows his 3 hearts.
- **Harpoon**: one shot at a time, straight up from the launcher tip (+0.35 u right of centre) at 20 u/s. A 1 px twisted steel cable stays where it was fired; a bubble touching the cable or the barbed tip pops. The tip stops under the first solid tile above it (a platform or the ceiling) and the tail hangs down to the first surface below.
- **Bubbles**: kinematic, with our own bounce maths (no physics engine). Constant 4 u/s sideways. Each tier always peaks at its height from the sheet (XL 13, L 11, M 8.5, S 6 u). They split into the next size (Trigloops into 3), kicked up and out. No eyes: type reads from colour plus a centre mark.
- **Screen**: renders at 480 x 270 with the URP Pixel Perfect Camera (15 px per unit, upscale render texture). The arena is always 32 x 14 u with a 4 u ground strip; wider or taller screens show extra scenery. Phones are locked to landscape.
- **Controls**: touch first, plus keyboard and gamepad (below).
- Placeholder pixel art is painted in code from the sheet's shapes and palette (`PlaceholderArt.cs`), so there are no image files yet.

Not in step 2 on purpose: ledges, the storm timer, other weapons, upgrades, audio, and most of the animation list (that is step 3).

## What step 3 adds (game feel, in progress)

Timings come from the sheet's animation table and live in `Tuning.asset` under **Feel**, **Wick animation** and **Sound**.

- **Wick**: run start stretches 0.9 x 1.1 and leans 8° with two dust puffs; stopping or reversing from speed skids (lean back 6°, one puff, 1.05 x 0.95 settle). Firing kicks the launcher down 2 px, squashes him and shows a one-frame mint muzzle flash. The launcher is now its own sprite part.
- **Pops**: a hit bubble swells to 115% during the 40 ms hit-stop, then one cream flash frame, the ring, droplets and the children.
- **Hurt**: Wick shows as a cream silhouette through the 120 ms freeze, then blinks.
- **Intro and clear**: he waves and rocks while facing you, the turn swap hides behind a dust puff, the celebration is two hops (stretch up, squash and dust on landing, arms up on the second) with confetti, and STAGE CLEAR drops in with a bounce.
- **Sound**: placeholder chiptune blips synthesised in code (`Scripts/FX/Sfx.cs`): fire, pop (higher for smaller bubbles), bounce, hurt, skid, turn, stage clear, game over. Volume and mute are in the tuning asset.

## Open it on desktop

1. Install **Unity Hub**, then **Unity 6000.6.7f1**. Add the modules **Android Build Support** (with OpenJDK and SDK/NDK) and, on a Mac, **iOS Build Support**.
2. Install Git LFS once per machine: `git lfs install`. Then clone this repo.
3. In Unity Hub: **Add > Add project from disk**, pick the repo folder, open it. If Hub offers a slightly different version, accept it. The pinned editor is 6000.6.7f1.
4. On first open:
   - If Unity asks to **enable the new Input System backends and restart**, click **Yes**. (Either answer works; the code supports both.)
   - The project setup runs by itself: it creates the URP 2D renderer, the tuning asset and `Assets/Scenes/Prototype.unity`. The Console says `[Bubblewright] Project setup done`. You can re-run it any time from the menu **Bubblewright > Run Project Setup**.
5. Open `Assets/Scenes/Prototype.unity` (or **Bubblewright > Open Prototype Scene**) and press **Play**.
6. In the Game view, pick a landscape size such as **1920x1080** or **16:9**. For phone shapes, switch the Game view tab to **Simulator** and pick a phone; it simulates touch too.
7. After the first open, commit what Unity generated (`Packages/packages-lock.json`, `ProjectSettings/*`, `Assets/Bubblewright/Settings`, `Assets/Bubblewright/Resources`, `Assets/Scenes`) so the project is reproducible.

### Controls

| Action | Touch | Keyboard | Gamepad |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Move | Drag left or right anywhere in the left half (relative to where your thumb lands) | A / D or arrows | Left stick or d-pad |
| Fire (hold to keep firing) | Hold anywhere in the right half (the mint button) | Space, J, K, W or Up | A / Cross, X / Square, RT or RB |
| Play again | Tap | R, Enter or Space | Start or A |
| Toggle test layout (debug) | Debug panel | F3 or debug panel | Debug panel |

The mouse acts as one finger, so you can try the touch controls on desktop: click and drag in the left half, click in the right half.

Debug keys on desktop: **1-4** spawn an XL Gloop, Trigloop, Lead or Lucky bubble; **F1** shows hitboxes; **F3** toggles the Tower test layout.

### Tuning

Every number lives in `Assets/Bubblewright/Resources/Tuning.asset`. Select it and edit in the Inspector, even while playing. Bubble gravity is derived per tier from its peak height and a bounce time, so it always reaches the sheet's peak height.

## Test it on a phone

**Android** (easiest):
1. On the phone: enable Developer options and **USB debugging**, then plug it in.
2. In Unity: **File > Build Profiles**, select **Android**, click **Switch Platform**.
3. Make sure `Assets/Scenes/Prototype.unity` is in the scene list, then **Build And Run**. Pick a file name for the APK; Unity installs and launches it.

**iPhone** (needs a Mac with Xcode):
1. **File > Build Profiles**, select **iOS**, **Switch Platform**, then **Build**.
2. Open the generated Xcode project, choose your Apple ID team under Signing, plug in the phone and press Run.

Hold the phone sideways: left thumb drags to move, right thumb holds the mint button to fire.

## Project layout

```
Assets/Bubblewright/
  Scripts/Core/      Game (bootstrap and loop), Tuning (all numbers), GameInput (touch/keys/pad), Palette and sorting layers
  Scripts/Player/    Wick: movement and all his procedural animation (run, skid, fire, hurt, turn, wave, celebrate)
  Scripts/Bubbles/   Bubble: own bounce maths, split children
  Scripts/Weapons/   Harpoon: cable and barbed tip
  Scripts/FX/        Effects (pop, dust, muzzle flash, confetti) and Sfx (placeholder sounds made in code)
  Scripts/UI/        Thumb controls drawn in the ground strip
  Scripts/Art/       PixelCanvas and PlaceholderArt: sprites painted in code at 15 px per unit
  Editor/            ProjectSetup: URP 2D renderer, tuning asset, player settings, scene
ProjectSettings/TagManager.asset   Sorting layers: Sky, Stage, Bubbles, Shots, Player, FX, UI
```

Units: 1 unit = 15 art pixels. Floor at y = 0, ceiling at y = 14, walls at x = -16 and +16. The ground strip is y = -4 to 0.

## Troubleshooting

- **Package errors on open** (a version in `Packages/manifest.json` not found): open **Window > Package Manager**, install **Universal RP** and **Input System** at the versions it offers, then run **Bubblewright > Run Project Setup**.
- **Sprites look blurry or the screen is not pixel perfect**: check that **Edit > Project Settings > Graphics** uses `Assets/Bubblewright/Settings/URP-2D.asset`, and that the Main Camera has a Pixel Perfect Camera set to 15 PPU, 480 x 270, Grid Snapping = Upscale Render Texture. Re-running the setup fixes both.
- **Nothing in the Game view before pressing Play**: expected. Everything is built when the game starts.

## Setup notes

- Unity's `.gitignore` is in place. Git LFS rules for images, audio, fonts, models, video and archives are in `.gitattributes`.
